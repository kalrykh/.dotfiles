legend gwaran
legend nalthic
t zelindo just a heads up in case he tries to join :p
t zelindo i'm thinking gwaran is nalthic.  so far he's the only Nick cronie I can't account for.  He was partying with Auri and he was on at the same time as Baern, Raiko, and Montog, so I know he's not one of them
t zelindo FUCK THIS UPTIME
t kinneth what level does that cut off
t kinneth for what, coffee?
t kinneth yeah, typing an alias about 20 times, i can see how that might take too much out of you :p
t kinneth :/
t kinneth use the rivendell trick stuff, not an actual trainer
t kinneth heh
t kinneth he
t kinneth well, that's a bit unlikely to happen
t kinneth long ass needles, i had to turn my head and not look :P
t kinneth i wanna play but i dont want to get equipped and then lose it randomly to reboot.  this crap needs to move :P
t kinneth lol.  only one i've seen is him holding a beer with his shirt off or some shit, after he claimed to be all built up or something, which was a lie :p
t kinneth oscar was sending you pics of oscar or pics of torug
t kinneth i think guild conflicts are more about personalities than anything else, and you're pretty drama free (except for harassing esker all the time :P)
t kinneth dodged a bullet there :p
t kinneth lol
t kinneth you've been GM quite a while now, how's that going? 
t kinneth i would assume most of the time you spend in caras is killing there, rather than training :p
t kinneth caras, bottom row or however you want to describe it.

t kinneth everyone needs companionship :P

t kinneth does this game have brothels, or something harder than pipeweed? there has to be a vice or two to frivolously blow gold on.
t kinneth so if you really need to spend that gold, l2dwarf :P
t kinneth to max i mean.  i think non dwarves, free race only, were limited to like 75% or something before
t kinneth :p
t kinneth well, you can train khuzdul now
t kinneth should have stayed in valinor a bit longer so i could see the stat changes i guess :p but i had no idea they were coming
legend nyssa
t kinneth is she white? i hear white people can't jump :p
t kinneth on my wizards, i usually never bother to cast because i get tired of getting my concentration broken.  so i wouldn't notice any changes that affected my strength as a casting wizard.
t kinneth do you use a lot of casting?
t kinneth i haven't put a lot of time into any one profession because I suicide chars like they're going out of style.  i only notice because i'm constantly leveling and doing the quests that are stat checks.
t kinneth yeah, but you're 119 days old on that char :P you've put a shit load of time into it.  and you're not a fucking idiot.  so i would expect you to notice changes :p
t kinneth some people might get a feeling that something was different, but without a way to verify it, might just blow it off
t kinneth some people would notice, some wouldn't.  maxed chars with 105 stats? probably not.  people leveling with someone else's gold, again, probably not, because they're not going through these stat check quests while not maxed out, which is what would give them pause to consider it
t kinneth and the fact that they didn't fucking say a word about it in news/updates gets under my skin
t kinneth there are various quests that are stat checks and i've noticed differences on dunedains, dwarves, uruks, and haradrim so far, which points to a large scale race rebalance
t kinneth and i'm kinda pissed off about it
t kinneth i haven't tried any of that stuff.  when they messed with shields/2 handers and stuff, they also adjusted a lot of the races, but didn't bother to announce it
enemy gwaran
t kinneth lol.  he was about 20 years older than me, married with two children, constantly complained about his wife.  his ringtone for her was "tainted love" by soft cell and it always cracked me up when she called.
t kinneth one of my old friends was quite optimistic about meeting someone new.  he always told me "no matter how great she is, someone else already got tired of her shit long ago" :P 
t kinneth well, won't know unless you try i guess. 
t kinneth haha
t kinneth give it time :p
t kinneth maybe you should try a guy that's shitty from the start so they can only get better :p
t kinneth if decent guys were common, it wouldn't take so many tries :P
t kinneth i'm not in the mood to laugh, stop making it happen
t kinneth haha not what i meant.  i meant the level of attention that usually comes with someone courting 
t kinneth usually after they have you they think it's no longer necessary to be up your ass all the time :p
t kinneth he got the house, you got the mud eh? :p
t kinneth i was about to ask if he was still playing

t kinneth keeps me from getting too irritated as well.  because the people who live to talk without actually saying anything never seem to go away...silain, carath, fingondor, rathmar, baklen :p
t kinneth i stay with my comms off these days, so it's always quiet.  only way i can keep from making an ass of myself.
t kinneth quiet where, here?
legend valgard
t kinneth i never read the silmarillion, so it seems good enough for me.  then again, i thought tolkien's writing was awful, so i'd much rather watch movie/tv adaptations than read it :p
t kinneth first 2 episodes, in the middle of the third
t kinneth that's a lot of pelting smol animals
t kinneth beorn then maybe? heh
t kinneth i'm sure he's an advocate
t kinneth radagast runs around with animals crawling all over him and poop running down his face
t kinneth i'm calling peta
t kinneth you can still get above 50 from fighting for some skills :/
t kinneth for level 5, yes, it's capped at 50
